# BiteSpeed Frontend Task
## Chatbot Flow Builder


## Overview
This project is a flow diagram editor created with React and react-flow. It lets users visually create and manage chat flow in one direction with nodes and edges. Users can drag and drop nodes, connect them with edges, and dynamically update node label with clickin on the node.


## Features

1. **Text Node**: Supports text messages, multiple nodes, added via drag-and-drop.
2. **Nodes Panel**: Extensible panel for adding different node types.
3. **Edge**: Connects two nodes, representing the message flow.
4. **Source Handle**: One edge can originate from each source handle.
5. **Target Handle**: Multiple edges can connect to each target handle.
6. **Settings Panel**: Replaces Nodes Panel when a node is selected, allows text editing.
7. **Save Button**: Saves the flow, shows errors if nodes have empty target handles.
